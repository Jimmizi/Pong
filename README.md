Pong
====

Single player and multiplayer pong game. Made in C++ and SFML, my first attempt at networking. Quite a bit of latency between different networked computers but runs well on the same machine.

In order to get multiplayer working, open one instance and set it to host the game, only then do you open the other to join that host (if on the same computer).

WS or Up and Down to control. 


Provided as is.
